This file needs to be deleted manually.

Run this command:
rm "/Users/eimis/Documents/HACKTHONS-2025/Chome AI Hackthon/safeguard-kids-dashboard/app/routes/api.incidents.ts"

We have two files with the same route:
1. app/routes/api.incidents.ts (DELETE THIS ONE)
2. app/routes/api/incidents.ts (KEEP THIS ONE)

Only one should exist.
